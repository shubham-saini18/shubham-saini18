## 👨‍💻 Who Am I?

I started my career in **DevOps**—messing with pipelines, fixing broken YAML at 2 AM, spinning containers, and making servers behave.  
Now, I’m expanding into **Data Science**, because why not mix automation with a bit of intelligence?

I’m basically on a mission to become that person who can:

- Build the infrastructure 🔧  
- Automate the deployment 🚀  
- Train the model 🧠  
- Deploy the model again (because DevOps never ends) 🤝

## ⚡ What I Work With

### 🌩️ DevOps & Cloud (My Comfort Zone)
AWS • Docker • Kubernetes • Terraform • Jenkins  
GitHub Actions • GitLab CI • Linux • Bash • Nginx  

### 🧠 Data Science (Currently Leveling Up)
Python • NumPy • Pandas • Matplotlib • Scikit-Learn  
(Still fighting with TensorFlow… we’ll get there 😄)

### 🧰 Other Tools I Like
MySQL • MongoDB • Postgres • FastAPI • Postman

## 🚀 A Little About My Journey

- I automate things… and then automate more things.  
- I enjoy turning complex deployments into one-click pipelines.  
- I love clean architecture, clean code, and clean logs (rare).  
- I’ve deployed microservices on AWS, EKS, and Dockerized setups.  
- Recently fell into the world of ML, and it’s pretty fun.  
- My end goal? **DevOps × AI = MLOps Engineer.**
